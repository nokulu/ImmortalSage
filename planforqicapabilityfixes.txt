### Plan for Qi Capability Fixes

#### Information Gathered:
- The `QiCapability` class is responsible for attaching the Qi capability to player entities.
- The `QiStorageImpl` class manages the Qi data associated with players.
- Warnings indicate that the capability is not being attached, likely due to issues with event triggering or player profile availability.

#### Plan:
1. **Review Event Handling**:
   - Ensure that the `onAttachCapabilities` method is being triggered correctly for player entities.
   - Check if the event bus is properly set up to listen for player-related events.

2. **Debugging**:
   - Add additional logging to track when the `onAttachCapabilities` method is called and what entities are being processed.
   - Verify that the player entity is correctly identified and that the game profile is available.

4. **Research**:
   - Investigate any known issues with the Forge event bus and capability system that may affect the attachment of capabilities.
   - Review documentation on capabilities in Minecraft Forge to ensure compliance with best practices.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Implement any necessary changes based on findings from debugging and research.
   - Ensure that the Qi capability is correctly registered and attached to player entities.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Document any changes made to the codebase and update comments to reflect the current logic and functionality.

#### Dependent Files to be Edited:
- `QiCapability.java`
- `QiStorageImpl.java`
- Any related event handling classes that may affect player capabilities.

#### Follow-up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.
